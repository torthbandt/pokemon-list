# pokemon-list
Display a list of Pokemons.  This was a JS technical question interview, which I got inspiration from James Q. Quick YouTube channel: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-VQUKeSU1w&list=WL&index=1&t=906s>

The quiz was to build a list of Pokemon's and display each Name, Image, and Type from the Pokemon API.

Display each in it's own container box, then have it display in a grid or inline display and responsive if possible.
